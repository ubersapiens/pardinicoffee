          I am not an NFL fan but I heard a quote the other day by one of the sport’s most amazing stars, Richard Shearman cornerback of the Seattle Seahawks, that stuck on my head for good. He said that in order to succeed and to be the best at what you do “you must become a student of the game”. Not just a spectator. Not just a dreamer.<br><br>
          Coffee has become to me the equivalent of da Vinci’s flying machine. An unquenchable obsession that keeps growing as the days pass by. What began with a cup of Pacamara in the highlands of Panama quickly turned into a social, psychological and mental journey into the very center of coffee culture. It was not just the absolute exquisiteness of the 800 taste profiles that could be found or the incredible ecosystem that turned around a single bean, but it went deeper. Knowledge is power. The power to create. The power to innovate. I wanted to take coffee to another level by pushing its nature. Research and passion led me to the art and science of roasting.<br><br>
          I began by building a lab. Like any scientist wanting to test a momentary hypothesis or an engineer wanting to poke the latest gadget, I needed a playground to experiment. Tips from baristas and a lot of reading led me to what you see below: a Quest M3 electric home roaster, a Hario mini mill burr grinder, a precision based digital balance, a Hario gooseneck kettle and the finest coffee beans I could get my hands on…of course they were from Drop Coffee Roasters. The extraction methods utilized vary from a French press to a Kalita to a v60 to cupping.<br><br>

          Being able to experiment is probably the most important part of becoming great at what you do. Let’s call that your craft. If you have seen the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi you will know what dedication to a craft means. For those who haven’t seen it, watch it. Waking up every morning and following a routine that pushes you every day more and more towards perfection. It could be with art or with music or with any craft. Now imagine being able to perform a craft that yields the fuel of your every day existence. That is what roasting the world’s finest and rarest coffees feels like to me.<br><br>
          So far I have roasted 136 times with numerous machines ranging from the first, a Diedrich IR25 at Drop Coffee in Stockholm, to the latest, a 1kg TJ067 in Paris. I have logged every single color change, every air flow increase and every crack (first, all, last). It has helped me understand little by little how different beans from different ends of the world can be manipulated and harnessed to produce the most delicious coffee the palate can have the pleasure of tasting. The problem with searching perfection is that you never reach it, you just keep trying to get closer, and that for me is enough. The third coffee wave is moving because most of its actors think in a very similar way. They search that perfect extraction, that perfect 27 leaf latte masterpiece, that perfect timing for opening the Probat’s hatch. They are shokunin…like Jiro.<br><br>
          Just imagine a place like Paris. I posted a video called Paris Awakening where some of the top players in the coffee culture scene here in the French capital give their takes on where this could all go. Paris has been enjoying and sourcing some of the best products we know in existence. From wines to cheeses to meats to vegetables. What happened with coffee? After watching I felt like everyone out there that is trying to educate the most educated culinary connoisseurs in existence how to drink their shot of daily coffee is just fighting Goliath, except the fight ends with Goliath sitting down and enjoying a clear fruity cup of Costa Rican Tarrazu.<br><br>
