          Money can be an issue when you are constructing in your imagination the dream coffee shop or the scientific roasting lab or the state of the art import facility. The truth is, it can be an issue if you allow it. I read the other day a great quote: “How do you eat a whale? One spoonful at a time”, which conveys the message here. Dreaming big but starting small is the way to go. A great friend founded MAKERS Cafe with those exact words in mind. Craft and coffee. What could be more simple? Yet so great. You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to do it.<br><br>
          Let me tell you the story of a little boy who dreamed of walking amongst coffee fields every morning of his life. He grew up and travelled far away from those fields but still wanted to feel the coffee so he learned its ways. He decided to show the people around him the treasures that a small fruit coming from 10,000 km away could unmask. After studying the art of roasting in 1001 ways, the want was still ever-present, but the do had not materialized. So he began to dissect and simplify the ecosystem that led to the ideal roast, and then found its affordable alternative.<br><br>
          The result was: a copper caserole (drum shaped), a metal tray with holes + a fan attached to the bottom (bean cooling), a 21 euro rotating battery engine (50-70 rpm) and a digital thermometer. The rest were extras. Heat source? The kitchen stove. With enough imagination and enough drive anyone can become MacGuyver (or at least a cheap, no mullet version of him). This home made drum roaster can handle up to 1.2 kg of coffee per session and each session lasts around 19 minutes from the minute the drum starts to heat to the minute the beans are dropped on the tray. I will upload the PSD as soon as I tinker it.<br><br>
          Yes while it may not produce the same quality or roast profile as a Probatino or a Diedrich IR25, the truth is, if the beans are good and the roast is properly executed, you will still get one hell of a cup. I am all for having a beautiful, shiny, controllable super machine to push the limits of perfection but it’s also nice to go down to the basics behind it. If you think about it, back in the day, people had to roast their coffee at home if they wanted to enjoy it. Stumptown and Caravan did not exist. Their are many countries, producing some of the most perfect beans ever seen, who have dodged the technologization of coffee in recent years. They keep it simple.<br><br>
          It always makes me think of a picture on the wall of one of the West Coast’s most revered coffee shops. It shows the picture of a family in Ethiopia, in the region of Yirgacheffe, all gathered around a stone pit filled with hot coals and an iron disc on top of it. The mother holds in her hand a wooden stick with a flat end which she would probably use to distribute and shuffle the roast. The rest of the family gazes with awe at the treasure heating up on top of that disc. They sit there without a clue that they will be enjoying one of the most coveted delicacies in the modern world in the rawest and most pure of ways. What a picture!<br><br>

          Simplicity above everything. It made me challenge myself a few months ago.<br><br>
          I work daily in the web 2.0 machine, so for a few weeks I self-imposed a tech diet while on vacations by travelling to a place disconnected from reality. But if there was one thing I missed while performing this Cast Away feat was the need for amazing coffee. You see, I am a true believer that humans are born to carry out a wide yet limited amount of tasks. However, to those who search beyond those limits, fuel is a need. Understanding, taming and harnessing the power of machines can be a daunting task if one searches for nothing other than perfection. And caffeine can be just the right source of energy to use machines to surpass man’s limited, yet hackable, innovative potential. But going back to missing coffee.<br><br> 
          I had brought with me to this hermit existence a bag of 750g of delicious honey catuai, gifted to me by a farmer, but with no way to roast it I began to think. On the morning of the third day I constructed a brick rock oven, lit a small fire and roasted 2 batches. I had no watch or phone battery so I estimated both first cracks around 10-12 minutes. I took them out and cooled them with a 1 minute difference to see which one came out better. And in the end, while one was too smoky and burned to feel any of the tastes, the second had enough tastes in it to wake up your imagination once again. Fuel or pleasure, the aromas and the feelings that it brought when it first touched the palate instantly reconnected many of my dormant neurons that hadn’t moved an inch in a while. It felt very close to watching football on an old small TV for years and years and one day watching Barca at the Camp Nou. <br><br>
          Fascinating concepts taken to pure, raw basics can yield fantastic outcomes.
