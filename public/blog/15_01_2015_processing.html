          In the land of the coffee and the badger, the honey rules over everything else. It's actually ironic that what started as an experiment that went down the wrong track became a few months after the most admired and coveted coffee processing technique a farm could utilize. They say honey-processed coffees are the <span style="font-style:italic;">creme de la creme</span> in any coffee shop or Michelin starred restaurant because they merge the ideal elements of the coffee fruit into the cup's taste profile.<br><br>
          Many roasters do not venture into the purchase of these coffee beans because they are extremely easy to scorch. Why? Because the honey-processed coffee is characterized by the solid fact that the sugars of the fruit are absorbed by the bean during processing, the final product is quite delicate and as such, easily burned (imagine the average French espresso...that's what I mean by scorched). However, those who tame it, can claim glory!<br><br>
          <strong>Stumptown Coffee</strong> know exactly what I am talking about. It all starts when "the fruit of the coffee plant, known as the cherry, is picked once it ripens on the branch. Mature coffee cherries can manifest themselves in red, yellow and orange pigmentation. After being harvested, cherries are transported to washing stations where they are weighed and then loaded into a depulping machine. The coffee cherry is then sliced open by either a metal or sharp plastic blade. The beans are squeezed out of the cherry via centrifugal force."<br><br>
          Up to this point, the processing is exactly the same as that of a washed coffee. Then comes the magic. Instead of removing the outer skin, also known as mucilage, the coffee is left with this coating. Due to the delicate nature of the bean and the mucilage covering it, honey-processed coffees must be dried on patios with good sun exposure. This of course implies a lot more attention from the producers and the farmers because it means constant attention. A magnificent honey-processed catuai could be lying in a patio and if not taken care of correctly (ie using a rake to turn it several times per day to ensure an evenly dried bean), could go to waste. But if done by the book, the mucilage will dry into the bean itself and create the most delicious coffee profile of all.<br><br>

          We can also see it strictly from a roaster's point of view. For those of you with Quest M3s and Hottops...lucky...happy roasting. But for those with big drums, keep your heat within 180 degrees Celsius before charging. Home roasting units won't have a problem, but if you have a large drum roaster, don't preheat it above 180 degrees Celsius.  Depending on the origin, the heat manipulation will change. The mucilage is composed of sugar and alcohols. Once lying in the core of the coffee bean it becomes part of the taste profile. This also makes the coffee beans a lot more flammable. When they are heated correctly it produces a balanced utopia of sweetness, acidity and tastes never experienced.<br><br>
          Not many people are familiar with this type of processing because it is a bit like fixed gear bikes in the 1990s...just a niche niche trend. But some of the best producers in the world are now receiving their highest SCAA cupping scores ever, with coffee that had competed as washed and natural plenty of times. A few days ago I had the pleasure of tasting a honey-processed catuai coming from the Lamastus' Elida farm in Alto Quiel, Panama. The taste profile is one of the finest I have ever encountered because it mixed a 1700 meters arabica wonder with a revolutionary process. The result, a fine balance between acidity coming from the delicious fruit trees growing in the farm to the sweetness in the sugar cane aftertaste of the cup (probably endowed by that caramely skin that blended into the coffee's profile).<br><br>
          Honey processed <strong>will soon be available</strong> in our shop!<br><br>
