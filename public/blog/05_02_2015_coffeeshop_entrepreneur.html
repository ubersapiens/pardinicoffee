          Many people think that Starbucks’ greatest contribution to present day happenings has been the gift it made to humanity, allowing it to go into a coffee shop, ask for a coffee and get a coffee. A pretty good coffee (according to the 99%). That could have been true in 2002, before the third wave of coffee began to flood the palates of those wild enough to try the rare and exotic uber coffees. That’s when true specialty coffee was born. But just as that train began to take off, Starbucks morphed from just a coffee shop to the entrepreneur’s go to working space.<br><br>
          From one day to another, web 2.0 visionaries and liberal mindsets began to settle down into the leather couches and the chessboard engraved wooden tables. Coffee shops all around Europe and North America became the coworking spaces that gave roots to the idea of the sharing economy. The big difference between these entrepreneurs and those in the 80s and 90s was that garages and decrepit houses were no longer necessary to incubate potential and momentum. Remoteness became a rule. If your craft allowed it, you now possessed one of the greatest and most difficult to acquire assets in modern day: mobility. The Coffeeshop Entrepreneur Manifesto has as one of it's main commandments, the following phrase (imagine if it Kenyan, 18g, full bodied, 28sec):<br><br>

          When graduates, life shifters, unemployed, dreamers and in-transition individuals began to realize that all they needed in order to work was a laptop, a few gadgets and unlimited amounts of coffee, they flocked to coffee shops. Here you had a place where you were welcomed like you were the chief of the company, where everyone around you was pounding on ideas, where globalization was an every day thing and where you could eliminate all the distractions that an office or your home could create. Take the office scenario. After a regular day, quantify time spent working and idle/lunch time. You will notice that time spent working is not even half of the total hours sometimes. That’s why efficiency is the name of the game.<br><br>
          As coffee shops adapted their ecosystem to the huge swarm of entrepreneurs spending countless hours inside the premises, the product slowly began to change as well. While a $2 espresso was the norm before, so was the bitter disgusting taste that drinking that so called ‘coffee-derived’ shot left you with for a solid 20 minutes. The third wave of coffee brought with it a shift from quantity to quality that had never been seen before. Clients now had to pay $3 and sometimes up to $5 for a shot of espresso. But that shot had been ground with precision, it had been measured with exactness and it had been extracted with accuracy. Not only that, but the $2 aftertaste was there no more. Probably because the espresso was a funky natural processed coffee grown at 1,4000 meters in the Panamanian highlands. Instead, a sweet taste of white chocolate with a hint of orange zest remained on your lips until you had to taste another one.<br><br>
          The rise of the coffee shop entrepreneur merged geeks of all types into the same four walls. Whether you were a guitar played editing his latest concert on iMovie, a designer adding layers to his company’s logo or a coffee maniac jotting down notes on an Ethiopian filter. They all saw these wonderful places as the ultimate idea factories. Psychologists have said over and over how the mind produces at a higher capacity when it has ambient noise and spontaneous movement around it. Not only that but having the power to concentrate your work power hours into targeted bursts beats the 9-5 in terms of output any day of the week.<br><br>
          Third wave coffee shops are today’s utopic working spaces and to those who can afford mobility, an office is by far the worst place you could be at. No rent. Great ambience. Fast internet. Smart design. Amazing coffee. What else do you need to spark productivity.<br><br>
          Move! Create! Enjoy!<br><br>
