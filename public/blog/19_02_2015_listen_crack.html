         The more I have immersed myself in coffee, the more I feel like there is an exponential number of knowledge and experience that keeps increasing and I am just trying to catch up. So I decided to stop chasing all angles, from EK43 grind size tweaking to studying arabica biological traits and differences. And decided to focus for a bit on roasting. I began to put together a massive quilt of research that has cleared up the big picture that portrays the process of turning the green coffee beans into the roasted delicacies that we have sitting in the corner of our counter tops. One of the interesting elements that I discovered at the beginning was the scientific essence that revolves around all this. Heat. Air pressure. Botanics. Chemistry. Sugars and alcohols. pH levels and test beakers. And the list goes on. Look at the incredible link between a lesser evolved step in evolution recognizing the potential of fire when applied to matter…roasting at its core. And that’s the beauty of it. All of it gives an allure to coffee. Turns it into a very geeky subject of conversation.<br><br>
         Although it does look like a process to make crack it’s actually one of the toughest and trendiest coffee brewing methods in the market. The amazing siphon. You can put it in a laboratory and no one would be able to distinguish that from a large hadron collider. So behind all that trendiness and that geekyness, coffee becomes a science in itself. Coffee fanatics live for the perfect cup of human fuel.<br><br>

         With roasters it’s not about the hats or the mustaches…in the end it all boils down to the crack. Imagine being an Olympic sprint athlete and training your system over and over to react the micro second after you hear that GO signal because you know that a false start will disqualify you and a late start will leave you second or worst. Roasters depend on the crack to measure there development times, their curves, their recipes and overall, their stylish timing. It’s those precious seconds that distinguish Drop from PT’s and Coffee Collective from Tim Wendelboe.<br><br>
         Recently such super senses and such use of tech has been pushed to a new level. You see, the cracking sounds emitted by coffee beans, first and second if existent, were analyzed by machines to find a correlation between the time after crack (per individual coffee variety) and the tastes/aromas perceived from each cup, to find a ‘sweet spot’. The following was noted: a) first crack emits a higher acoustic amplitude than second crack, b) first crack emits more low frequency energy, c) second crack has a more uniform group rate than first crack. Coffee roasters, rely on their hearing as a primordial indicator that the coffee is almost ready. The roasting process terminates when the roaster extinguishes the fire and opens the hatch, unleashing the roasted beans into a cooling compartment. Who would be right, a machine acting on tons of correlated data or a human ear letting itself be driven by a thousand and one roasts?<br><br>
         Although every one has their own way of looking at things and in the end that is what makes their coffee or their style different, the truth is everyone starts with some sort of data (whether it was read in Wikipedia or you heard it at your local coffee shop). From there we know that usually first crack comes around 200 C and second crack around 230 C (usually with two minutes between each other). Other than that, you are pretty much in the fog. As you hone your senses, you also hone your talent and your ability to make the right decisions regarding the time, the color and the smell that you want your coffee exhibiting before you are ready to take it out. You always have the certainty that if you don’t call it right…your beautiful green coffee beans that were labored so hard in a far away land filled with tropical valleys and tall volcanoes…will be nothing but ashes.<br><br>
         If you are in for some coffee roasting comedy, watch Olympia's video and wait for the part where they start talking about their patented "caramelization" roasting process. Initially the learning curve with timing the perfect development time after first crack is a super steep one, but once you start taming your drum and cleaning up your ears, you will see the magic.<br><br>
         So listen carefully!<br><br>
