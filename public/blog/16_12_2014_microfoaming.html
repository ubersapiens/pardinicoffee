          Its all in the vortex. This is the trick behind that foamy, sweet, delicious milk that swirls on top of your cup of cappuccino. Chris, from Fondation Cafe, showed me time after time how important it was to introduce the milk steamer, magic wand or in this case, the fulcrum, into the milk jar. The angle at which the hot air entered into the milk determines how fast the milk will rise and how well you will be able to control the uniform bed of foam that covers the surface. So to get the concept down perfectly we drew and x, y, z plane that resembled a compass where the fulcrum needed to enter the serving part of the jar (let's say North) towards either the middle of the east dividing plane or the middle of the right dividing plane. Then it would be a matter of finding the adequate inclination on the jar in order to direct the air flow in parallel to the surface of the milk. If done properly, the result is a beautiful vortex that turns with or against the clock.<br><br>After getting that milk turning with a perfect vortex and a right degree of inclination, then comes the introduction of air into the milk. The closer the head of the fulcrum is to the surface of the milk, the more air will be injected into it. Pumping it usually lasts around 4 seconds and then the fulcrum must go back into the jar to continue the initial vortex until the milk reaches a perfect temperature. Now, every barista has his or her way of knowing when that moment has arrived: some will use timers, some will judge it by just using their eyes, but if you wanted to play it safe and sound, when the milk jar reaches a temperature that does not allow you to hold it for more than 3 seconds, then your milk is ready. At plain site it should look like a sugary bed of clouds that you wanted to lie on top of. That's good milk. What the coffee intelligentsia refer to as microfoam.<br><br>Now that I have told you how to make microfoam, let me tell you a story about the real key to everything, the quality of the milk. This story is about a discovery I made while living in Switzerland. I had been told that there was a place in the middle of the Swiss countryside with a delicious treasure. To reach it you had to take a train from Geneva to Montreaux then switch and go up to Montbovon to then take a little train to the medieval wonder known as Gruyeres. So when I got there I was initially received by a smell of fresh cheese and a perfectly conserved military fortress from the age of knights, Gruyeres Castle. I headed over to a small spot called Giger Cafe, known in the coffee circles as Galactic Cafe. Why? No idea. But I can take a guess that the word 'lactic' plays a role. Server asked for my order, I asked for a latte. This was the test to the myth. And then it arrived.<br><br><img src="/images/cow.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto;"><br>Tasting it wasn't the problem. It was so good that I did not pay attention to it's scorching temperature. I can honestly say that I had a latte with an espresso shot that could have been a bit over-extracted or even a bit overdosed, but the milk was so good that none of it mattered. It was foamy like a bed of clouds. The texture was viscous to such extent that you could count various seconds while it trickled down from the spoon. And the taste was the cherry on the cake. Chris taught me that the intense heat from the steam going into the milk breaks down the lactose and delivers the sugars that make, in some lattes and cappuccinos, the perfect balance between sweet and bitter. What they call in the coffee world, long dans la bouche...a full taste experience.<br><br>I was so intrigued about the importance that milk had on the coffee shop industry, that I dug the internet and came up with a lot of info which can be summarized in this post. No wonder that little place in the Swiss country side had that incredible taste. Milk in Switzerland is recognized worldwide for having a quality that no other country can match...not even the Americans with their genetically enhanced cattle. Doesn't matter where you look at it from, whether it's quality control, protein/bacteria content or just taste, the Swiss win. So Giger Cafe had innocently, or perhaps knowing, that they were serving their clients a microfoam of such quality that when mixed with coffee it hid its defects. It made me remember a coffee I had once in Panama made by the same guy growing that coffee where the water used to filter this coffee came directly from the spring that passed by his farm that flowed through all the erosive land in the skirts of the Volcan Baru to deliver the cleanest taste profile I had ever cupped. I can't even imagine what a latte would taste like if we used Swiss cow milk and our espresso was extracted with Panama natural spring water. Fountain of youth?<br><br>It is microfoam that allows some of the world's top baristas to design the unbelievable when pouring this foamy substance over the surface of their coffees. In reality if you saw it from an aesthetic point of view, the espresso shot in a latte becomes like the canvas of a barista and the microfoam becomes the watercolors that he used to bring that standard image into a delightful art piece.<br><br>Putting it into practice is another story. Here we go. Espresso is ready after 28 seconds extracting. It looks good. Thick and with a nice layer on top. I clean the magic wand with a quick spray and guide it towards my milk jar. I turn on the steam and take a few seconds to get that vortex. Once happy I pull the wand to the surface to get some solid air injected. When I had a solid bed of microfoam on my jar and my hand just gave me the 3 second rule, I give the wand a swipe and a spray, then grab my espresso and I begin to pour my milk while I notice the label saying something in French resembling 'extra fat milk'. I slowly build the body of the latte and right at the end I tilt the cup towards me while increasing the pouring action and allowing the foamy fat to coat the top of the cup. I manage to pull off a decent heart with a sharp twist. Success! <br><br>
