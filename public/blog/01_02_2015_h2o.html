          I guess most people that try specialty coffee usually do so in big metropolises, meccas of civilization...NY, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney. And even though that all sounds extremely chic, the reality is that those specialty coffees could be enhanced exponentially with just a slight change: the water. You have no idea what a difference it would make to have two coffees in front of you, one made with water dripping down from a 4,000 meter high volcano and the other one dripping down from a faucet in an 8 person per square meter city. Exactly the same variables, just changing the water. Those are pretty extreme cases but you could actually get quite close. Just think of Hawaii and London. Or Costa Rica and Seattle. One would be very good. But the other one would be exquisite. Tastes would jump out at your palate, clarity would be noticeable throughout the entire sensation and the texture, for those who dig to feel through the entire coffee, would be ideal.<br><br>
          Scott Guglielmino, from La Marzocco, gave a solid presentation on water quality and it's immense importance in coffee making. pH levels, mineral content, distillation and other factors play a massive role in what you drink from the cup. I remember during my barista training at Fondation Cafe how I was given a 90 minute explanation on the water balloon, its functions, its maintenance, etc. I knew how much it cost, why it cost so much and how that extra expense was increasing the quality of the coffee by quite a bit. We got so much into the topic that we started talking about the ways in which the water's quality can be measured and how there are very trendy coffeeshops in the deep corners of the world who use lasers and shoot them through the water to see the obstructions, the content and other scientific measurements that I did not pay attention to. There is a whole world behind the H2O used for coffee. Not only on the quality but also on the management of the water supply and the distribution of such. There is a lot of room for optimization and innovation. I am sure open minded countries thinking of the well being and the conservation of mankind's dearest resource are taking measures to make sure the coffees keep tasting delicious while using half the amount of water that the coffeeshop utilizes.<br><br>
          Coffee gadgets like refractometers have made the third wave of coffee look more like Web 2.0 than the arabica revolution. But these tools have enabled us to understand coffee in an almost ideal water medium.<br><br>

          Casper Engel, master roaster at Coffee Collective, told me a wonderful story once. Casper and I began talking when I approached him looking for knowledge and advise. In my search to learn the science of coffee roasting I decided to make it even more interesting. I would not settle for average. I wanted to probe the best minds in the industry, didn't matter if it was behind a Probat or an Ambex or a 1920s refurbished steampunk machine. A friend in Paris who had worked with Casper spoke wonders about the Prometheus of Copenhagen. He told me about a passionate guy whose only interests were roasting, Django Django and a nice smoke every now and then. So I wrote him and the story he told me when we first spoke was quite captivating.<br><br>
          Casper lives in Copenhagen. Casper loves coffee. So what is the point I am trying to make? A craftsman who lives far away from the source of his passion and one day gets to flavor the fruits of his craft at that source will forever live happy. This is what happened to Casper when he went to Panama's crown jewel in the coffee industry, Boquete. A place so incredible and so breathtaking that countless people have arrived upon the top of its valley and decided to stay there for the rest of their lives. It is in this valley, 6 hours drive from Panama City, that Casper tried the most delicious coffee he had tried in his life. As he immersed himself in the coffee farms, he was offered a coffee made with water coming straight from the spring. This water emanated from a water eye on the sides of a volcano causing the water to filter down through various layers of rock to reach the drip from which it was served. The combination of the purest of waters and an altitude of more than 1,000 meters produced the ideal environment. It was at this moment in time that he finally had before him all the elements to craft perfection. When he sipped that delicious, steaming coffee while staring at vast vegetation wherever he looked and feeling the wind under a light jacket, it was just awesome. The sensation was so incredible that Casper can recall second by second what he felt during that moment. He was so impressed by the quality of the water and the effect it had on the filter coffee he had at the farm that he decided to take some in a container back to Coffee Collective. Don't know how that one passed through airport security but I hope he enjoyed a nice brew. The thing we do for magic water!<br><br>
