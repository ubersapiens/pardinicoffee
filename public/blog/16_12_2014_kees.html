          You want to measure a coffee shop by it's eye to detail, avant garde coffee standards and most importantly, its cool factor, then just take a quick look at the machinery in their working area. If you know what you are looking for, you will know quickly where to look but for those that are unfamiliar with coffee labs, you have the espresso machine, the precision scales, the coffee bean grinder and the different filter methods. All of those are necessary elements in a coffee shop, yet the quality, the cutting edge and the uniqueness of some of these machines contribute to the innovation of the 3rd wave.<br><br>If you have never stopped and stared at an espresso machine then you have never seen a Kees. In the barista world, Kees van der Westen is like the Jonathan Ive of espresso machines. He met his first espresso in the 80s but it wasn't until he used the machine that made it as his final university project that he realized its potential. Fast forward 30 years and this man's machines are sometimes the centerpiece in the decoration of a coffee shop due to their aesthetics. Not only are they beautiful, but they also deliver performance. Espresso has been made by forcing water through the grinds at 9 bar, or 131 pounds per square inch, for 25 seconds (remains the standard today). The ideal brewing temperature, on the other hand, is hotly contested, although all agree it lies somewhere between 180 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (82 and 96 degrees Celsius). The trick is to deliver the water at exactly the right temperature throughout the brew cycle, even if the machine is simultaneously steaming milk or extracting another shot. And these machines pull off that trick every time. They look like spaceships shrank to Lego size. Or you could even see a touch of the style that was used on the dashboards of classic muscle cars in each of Kees' machines. The levers, the steam wands, the smooth design and the quality of the products that come out of them make these contraptions a must if you want to draw in the crowds of fixed gear wheelers and the avid trend hunters.<br><br>A real barista in a real coffee shop will always have at least one precision balance near their grinder or espresso machine. Not only will they have one but they will use it every time they pour coffee from the grinder and every time the pour espresso from the machine. Why? Because these two numbers can be divided and multiplied by 100 to obtain the coffee extraction ratio. Ratios vary according to personal taste or objective serving standards, but  just to see it used here's an example of how to get solid measurements: You turn on your balance and put the port-a-filter on top of it. Lock the value so that when ground coffee is added, it only weighs that. Add the ground coffee to the port-a-filter and place it on the balance. Remember this value. Weigh a small espresso cup on another balance if possible. Lock that value. Pour your espresso. After 20-30 seconds stop the machine. Check your balance. The first value divided by the second value turned into a percentage will give you the extraction ratio. Adjusting your grinder properly, pouring a dosage similar to the size of the basket and serving espresso for 24-30 seconds will generally yield a solid extraction ratio. This can later be fine tuned until satisfaction is attained. Bottom line being: barista without a bad ass precision scale = not a barista.<br><br>The grinder is almost as important as the espresso machine if not more because if your grind is not right it doesn't matter what machine brewed it, it would not be a good espresso. So just as I spoke about Kees, I will talk about the EK43. The first time I saw one of these was on at Prufrock in London, to later on find them at every coffee shop in Paris from Fragments to Telescope. So what is so special about this machine that looks like it was conceived in the industrial age and painted with a charcoal black to make it hip. Some people have said that the EK43 was designed originally for the spice milling industry because it exhibited improved grind particle size distribution resulting in the perfect solution for those could not manage decent extractions for both filter coffee and espresso brewing. Having one of these in your shop guarantees execution without having to worry too much about the level of mastery that the barista utilizing it possesses. But the grinders can be more efficient, less consuming and way cheaper. I always learned to have a grinder according to my needs. If I want quality only I could choose from a few others...if I wanted quality and to attract clientele, I would get an EK43.<br><br>Last but not least in the laboratory is the filtering methods. While many of us have used or seen French presses and the 'old sock' filtering methods that are used all over Central American countries. But only those who have ventured into specialty coffee shops have noticed the variety of methods that coffee can be filtered with. Starting with the V60. Every barista likes to make a nice V60 filter coffee because it's the one of the smoothest way to get a solid caffeine dose, a delicious taste and a cup that will probably last you a 10 minute conversation. The secret behind it is all in the timing. The serving, the waiting, the pouring. In the end, if weighed and timed properly it can deliver quite a cup. Another one circulating around every Belleville-supplied coffee shop in Paris is the famous Aeropress. Why? Because for those who want a quick, well made filter coffee, this is the answer. Using air pressure and gravity to create the perfect blend, this type of press will make far better morning coffees than your very well known French press, and with half the coffee.<br><br>In the end your coffee bar is like your chemistry lab. If you want people to stop by and gasp at the type of machinery and the processes that the barista is taking care of, then a good set of tools is in order. However, if you are a home experimenter, then looks are your last priority (except if you are a designer)...you are better off focusing on quality and cost. Do your research. Use your imagination.<br><br>
