          As much as I am a coffee maniac, I am also very passionate about the web, and one point where I see both fields crossing trajectories very often is in the field of innovation. Their are countless technology mavericks that have struck a chord with a talent to innovate, but in the world of coffee this is not seen very much. Coffee innovation does not just mean using eco-friendly picking and processing methods. It is the junction where brand, quality and drive meet. In 2013, just as I was starting to taste the sweetness of this new wave of specialty coffees, I had the chance to meet one of the most innovation-seeking trailblazers of this coffee revolution, Joseph Brodsky.<br><br>
          I met Joseph for dinner at one of my favorite restaurants in Panama. Corvina al ajillo with a bit of lemon and a cold cerveza Panama. Nothing could go wrong. Except...here I was sitting with the CEO of NinetyPlus Coffee and I was talking to him about delivering coffee by bike to subscribers. Quite a shame. You see, NP coffee sits at the top of every coffee shop's "I want list" and every roaster's "I need list". The name stands as such because none of their coffees score below 90 in competitions or rankings. It has been winning for a number of years top awards for their coffees, especially their geishas, originating from both Panama and Ethiopia. Countless world barista champions have delivered knockouts with Nekisse and Percy Red. So as you can deduce, no bike messenger would be delivering this coffee...a chariot with unicorns would be needed. It's just on another level.<br><br>

          Actually since I mentioned Ethiopia, let me tell you a bit about this pioneer that was sitting across the table with me. Joseph came from a family devoted to coffee but he chose to take a step further and he embarked on a hunt to find the most rare, the most exclusive and the most exquisite coffee beans in the phase of the Earth. The third wave of coffee was just picking up speed and like a rainmaker anticipating the coming rain, he created NinetyPlus Coffee, a company dedicated to growing, drying, processing, roasting and selling the most coveted beans in the specialty coffee marketplace. At first they focused solely on Ethiopia. Ironically the best beans in the planet where coming from the birthplace of coffee in the first place. Joseph had also grown quite fond of Ethiopia and had played a leading role in getting the world's eyes on this little country in Eastern Africa.<br><br>
          In 2010, having established themselves as the ones to beat, they acquired a 331 acre sustainable farm in Panama which had growing in its premises various lots of geisha trees. Now for those who don't know, the geisha coffee bean is to the producer/roaster/barista as the Champions League is to any European football team. The ultimate experience. Not only did they have this special tree growing there, but the weather conditions, the altitude, the soil and Joseph's innovative thinking created a utopic environment for the finest of coffees.<br><br>
          <img src="/images/baru.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto;"><br><br>
          It was this farm that became the scenario of my obsession with coffee. It was also the first time I saw coffee being produced this way. Joseph had been kind enough to invite me and a few others to visit NinetyPlus Geisha Estates in Silla del Pando, Panama. Many books have stated that the higher the coffee is grown, the better the taste will be. Not true in this case. These farms are all between 1,200 and 1,700, giving the coffee plants the necessary conditions to grow perfectly. The soil around it is filled with minerals coming from the volcano that rises above all the farms. The farms have fruit trees, jasmine trees and other floral plants that often give those hidden touches to a coffee's taste. And the temperature/precipitation conditions couldn't be better.
          <br><br>
          NinetyPlus' farms are farther away from where most producers are located in the Panamanian highlands. It is under this isolated environment that Joseph, along with other individuals who live and breathe coffee every day, manages to push the level of his coffee and the profiles that can come out of those magic grains. I remember a few weeks later, after the visit to the farm, emailing Joseph and trying to get him on Skype but I couldn't because he was out of reach somewhere in the farms concentrated on roasting and cupping, and would continue to do so for a couple of days. Producing coffee can generate a level of attachment in some but others, it can even become an infatuation. Those are the ones that will push the boundaries. While overlooking the farms you feel it and you can sense it. Not only can you see a difference in the coffee plants that cover Silla del Pando, but you can also notice that the setup is different to other places. It's utopia.<br><br>

          Sustainable and eco-friendly practices give NinetyPlus an engineered edge. Whether washed, natural or honey, the drying and processing techniques employed at these farms are optimal. African drying beds are modified with cutting edge materials to create triple tiered bunk bed systems to dry medium to large harvests. Many people don't know but a natural coffee is dried without removing the fruit, meaning the beans remain inside and  this guarantees optimum conditions for fermentation. In selected areas there are drying beds filled with beautiful ruby red cherries. Personnel in the farms are trained and instructed only to pick the ripest and most perfect cherries. This guarantees top quality across the board over and over, not just a fluke. I also had the chance to see the assemblage of an old school trailer that was reconverted into a coffee bean drying chamber which will be used to finish off the job when the sun dried coffee beans reach around 12-14% water content. The guys at the farm are so into the whole sustainable existence that they have a small garden filled with some of the most colorful vegetables I have ever seen. Big red tomatoes, giant juicy carrots. Every detailed taken care of.<br><br>
          Joseph made a great decision when he decided to bring in the Hartmanns to help him administer the Silla del Pando Farm. The grandsons of Alois Hartmann, one of the first settlers in that volcanic region, live and breathe coffee. One of them, Alex, was managing the farm when I visited and I remember halfway through the visit he stopped and said: "You need to understand...coffee runs in my blood". This is why they work all day to improve the practices to make the taste more exquisite. Because they were born with it growing around, they learned about it and then they loved it. There are many men out there who are trying to innovate the culture and world behind it but not many people can speak with the conviction and with the vision that Joseph first showed me. My favorite element of my daily routine was those 20 minutes where I heat the water, I pour ground coffee into my french press and then I savor the moment. Thanks to Joseph and NinetyPlus I saw the potential behind it. It was while I thought about this that a little devil in my head began to whisper "You will become a coffee man".<br><br>
