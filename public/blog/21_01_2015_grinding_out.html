          When I decided it was time for me to setup a coffee lab at home, the most important item on my list (after the coffee beans of course) was the grinder. Why? Because unlike espresso machines (like a Kees Mirage) and filtering contraptions (like the famous siphon), the grinder is chosen for it’s functionality rather than for its appearance (the other two are usually quite shiny and can catch the attention of anyone in the premises). Maybe some of you might even be saying that this shouldn’t even be put up to discussion and that the EK43 is the coolest thing to be put inside a coffee bar since baristas started using their fixies as props and deco.<br><br>Let’s get down to the basic theory behind the grind: increasing/decreasing the surface area available for extraction. Here’s a little secret. Post-roasting, the coffee beans are filled with carbon dioxide which serves as a protective shield to prevent those delicious aromas from becoming oxidized. Why? Because 4-5 weeks after roasting, that carbon dioxide releases it’s last drop and when it disappears, oxygen can roam free. The result: ruined coffee (supermarket coffee).<br><br>So what happens when you grind?<br><br>All that carbon dioxide residing inside those magnificent beans gets released, allowing for oxidation to begin. This is why the third wave of coffee has made it its mantra to only brew, extract, press and filter, freshly ground coffee. And while many claim that this is a mandatory practice at their establishment, their is a very easy way of checking if in fact the coffee beans going into your cup are at their most pristine estate. You see, a freshly ground coffee lying at the bottom of a french press or sitting inside a chemex filter, will react to added water depending on it’s freshness. And the effect couldn’t be more obvious. It’s all in the bubbles.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">Mechanical grinding of coffee serves to greatly increase its surface area, which in turn facilitates the extraction process. The coffee also becomes heated during grinding, however, and poor milling practices allow temperatures as high as 100 °C to be attained. A good coffee mill is so constructed that the warming phase persists for only a few seconds, and the rise in temperature of the mill’s grist is minimized. The coffee mill is in fact just as important for the quality of espresso as the espresso machine itself. In home brewing this is the place that most often suffers from false economizing.</span><br><br>I remember reading this excerpt in a very complete grind size to extraction yield study a few days before looking at the players that would make up my coffee lab. It made me modify my Amazon cart at least 8 times. From Bodum to CuisinArt. From metal blades to ceramic burrs. From electric to manual. The choice became such an issue that countless hours of online research was not enough. I approached at least 6 different baristas and asked for tips. When their advice made a lot more sense than everything I had read online, I bought my grinder. It wasn’t an EK43 (I will get that one when I find an unclaimed wallet with $2000 inside). But it also wasn’t one of those single setting metal blade electric grinders sold at Walmart with a bag of Starbucks’ finest blend.<br><br>I chose to go simple and classic with a Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill grinder (for cupping purposes I got an electric burr grinder as well) . With the Hario I had the perfect machine for home experimentation. It had ceramic burrs, which became a priority for me after learning that metal blades wear out faster and produce less uniformity in the grind. It had grind size settings for every brew style, whether it was coarse for a cupping or a french press or fine for an espresso or a Kalita. To be honest, it also had an added element that I found absolutely essential and a big plus: the manual grind.<br><br>Ever since I started studying the craft behind making the best cup of coffee possible, I began to grow fond of every single detail in the process and if there is one thing that I took extra interest in was the manual labor put into it. Whether it was carrying a 60kg bag up to the depulping machine or burst-pouring a V60 every 30 second interval, I treasured this. Being able to grind my coffee with nothing but muscle-motor performance, to hear beans that travelled from across the globe turning into the finest powder and smelling that freshly ground delicacy ready to put a smile on anyone who tries it. That’s amazing.<br><br>
