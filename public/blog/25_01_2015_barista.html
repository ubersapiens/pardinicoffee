          A visionary once said that if you want to stop the world on its rotating axis “you must not do it for anything else but yourself”. He also said that the key to success is self-discipline. And he laid down a base to sharpen a person into wielding a strong work ethic and best of all, evolving into an action oriented specimen. It is very easy to think about doing something or to study the possibility of going somewhere, but until you start putting one foot in front of the other you will never get anywhere (like the bean bag in the corner). That was pretty much the status quo of Western Europe when it came to coffee. Going nowhere. It was the baristas who emerged from far away lands and from local neighborhood shops who began the revolution. With sweat and work they constructed the coffee scene that you see today around you.<br><br>
          When I arrived in Paris, the coffee culture was just beginning to bloom, no one could have foreseen the spotlight that was thrown on the French coffee culture as a whole. Here you had a country with the finest delicatessen, the most elaborate food fusions and the tradition for impecable creativity, yet the coffee could be compared to that served in 1984’s dystopian society. A few young entrepreneurs would change that little by little. Here you had 20 something year olds coming from Norway, Australia and the West Coast of the United States, working behind the counters of Paris’ newest trend…specialty coffee. And even though, at first, these spots were filled with coolhunters and international men of mystery, the guys behind the counter came from the New World’s Working Class. Not from the 1% or from the extreme, but sitting right in the middle. Looking at opportunity in the eye and taking it. But the big difference between this lot and the one that already had a few “gourmet coffeeshops” open before the third wave hit was the idea behind this piece…self-discipline.<br><br>

          Let me tell you a story. I wanted to learn how to make coffee, but with an awesome touch. Not just the rarest coffee I could find but the most elaborate and most delicious way of preparing it. I learned this and more from one of the most hard working people I know. This guy had been a globetrotter like many people in the coffee industry. Worked the entire gamma of coffee jobs. And he settled in Paris, for a bit. Put up a coffee shop. Minimal. More lemonade stand than Starbucks, but cool. He worked his ass off without breaks or employees just to the point where exhaustion kicked in. When everyone else closed for vacations, he stayed open. Now you can see the smile on his face when the place is packed. Why? Because he knows he makes the thickest 28er in town. And because he earned it. He told me countless times that it wasn’t about the latest trend or the weirdest coffee, it was about consistency…repetition…precision. Only then could you say you have truly mastered the craft you work with. The perfect coffee comes when the planets align once in a century. But the excellent coffee can be found in very very few places.<br><br>
          Baristas are role models in this arena. They built that self-discipline we keep referring to almost in complete synchronization with that conceived by the visionary. Many psychologists that study motivation and habit in people have said that the key to a great day is a perfect morning. What can be more perfect than waking up to the smell of fresh grounds, gearing up, riding a fixie through Parisian morning rush hour and creating someone’s fuel source for the day? Maybe that’s not everyone’s routine. But the idea is the jump to action morning routine. Ask any barista what his day is like and with a big smile they will tell you a great story of how it went, but behind that great story there was a 14 hour shift with only a 30 minute break and 10kg of coffee served. That is incredible. Not only that, but they do it very different to the average human who spends half of their day on the phone or on social media. They go offline while they are behind the bar. Serious work ethic. Rigurous and efficient. But also, an art in itself. And no matter how heavy or how tough that day was, they always have time for their friends, a good chat about Scandinavian design and a fresh-cool IPA.<br><br>
          Hard work and fun times. Isn’t that what life is all about?<br><br>
