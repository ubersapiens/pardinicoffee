          Have you ever taken one of those wine tasting courses? I haven't. But like many others, I know more or less what they do (or at least I would like to think so). However, there's very few people that know that a coffee cupping is very similar, but much more meticulous. Coffees can have over 800 different flavors and aromas. Wine doesn't even have half of that, so it is a bit ironic, that the finest palates and the finest noses are usually in the wine domains rather than the coffee ones. This of course has to do with history, markets, trends and of course, prices. That being said, cupping coffee can be one of the most analytical yet pleasure inducing past times (that could turn into serious professions) that you can practice. A solid combination of seeing, tasting, inhaling, smelling, feeling, memorizing and most importantly, enjoying.<br><br>
          At some point in my coffee craze, I decided that I needed to go to Stockholm. Sodermalm is Brooklyn. And <a href="http://www.dropcoffee.se/" style="text-decoration:none;">Drop Coffee</a> is God. I went to learn, to train and to work with the finest group of coffee enthusiasts this small world holds. I used to joke and call them 'the Barcelona team' of coffee culture. For any football lover, and even if you support Real Madrid, you can't help but gasp at the style of play and cohesion that the team from Catalunya exhibits. Joanna created, Jelle and Jacob distributed, Eric closed in. They delivered a product that was incomparable. How? Because they practice, they work and then they keep practicing. And cupping lies at the base of it all.<br><br>
          It was Thursday morning, 8:30am and this is what I encountered.<br><br>
          <img src="/images/alex_ruas.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto;"><br>
          In order to run a coffeeshop you need to taste, approve and like what you are going to serve. In order to run a roastery you need to try, to see and to smile at what you are going to sell. Even farmers have to cup, in order to see which lot of land out of the 60 he has, all holding exactly the same plant species, is producing the most perfect experience. Why? Maybe to him because one lot will be worth $5 per kg and the other $32 per kg. And I could go on with sourcers, judges and more. The team at Drop Coffee told me over and over that in an ideal world, they would all be cupping twice per day, every day. The senses are a bit like the muscles, the more you work them, the more you practice using them, the higher the performance that they will render when called upon to act.<br><br>
          "Just keep cupping".<br><br>
          I was a bit frustrated that morning because up to that point I had comprehended the most minute details when it came to roasting, espresso and filter, but when we got to cupping I could not taste the amazing profiles that the rest were describing. Caramel aftertastes, blueberries, silky feeling and the most tempting, Caribbean rum. All I tasted was defects, meaning wood, old books and earth. It was like I lived in Bizarro world. They tasted all the good stuff, I tasted all the trash. I saw this as a major flaw, when apparently it was a very useful talent for a beginner. The rest could be taught (more like guided). So off we went with the scenario I had in front of me.<br><br>
          The entire team cupping coffees from Kenya and Central America, with a special surprise, the world's best Panamanian geisha, from <a href="http://www.ninetypluscoffee.com/" style="text-decoration:none;">NinetyPlus Coffee</a>. We all got SCAA protocolar judging sheets (I will talk about this on Cupping 101) and the cupping started. After smelling dry, wet and crustless we wrote down thoughts and scores. We let it sit for a while and then the slurping and spitting began. Always a must, and yes, I still laugh through some parts of it. A few rounds and everyone started writing down scores and notes through the entire sheet. I was still stuck at trying to find out what was that yellow fruitish taste I had felt on the first cup. Everyone writing down line after line of  sensations and elements out of that 800 spectrum. Me? Still trying to find that fruit. I had a few scores down but I was starting to get a bit impatient (I still had 10 coffees to try). And boom! Bananas. <br><br>
          Among other things but clearly that was the delicious difference that I had found on this coffee from the skirts of Santa Barbara, Honduras. It is produced by a bad ass looking man called Neptaly Bautista. A man with the talent to grow, tend and harvest probably the finest coffee I have ever tasted in my life. And I hope to one day meet him and learn from him. I am sure that he will show me the beautiful banana trees that grow near his coffee plantation because when you taste it you can see it holds the sweetest yellow fruit taste a coffee could have. So after such a delightful sensation I passed on to the second coffee, which ended up being an over-roasted Pacamara from El Salvador. No bananas there. Then the next, and the next. And at the end of it I tasted the geisha from Panama. Now this coffee is clearly in another league compared to any other coffee I have tried, but you couldn't compare it to the ones on the cupping table. It would be like putting Mike Tyson in a ring with Manny Pacquiao. But amongst the ones on the table, my favorite remained Mr. Bautista's creamy, banana tasting masterpiece.<br><br>
          The cupping took approximately one hour (probably because I took ages to finish judging), but the learning experience was priceless. When diving into the coffee culture and discovering the ocean of elements that you can find in each cup, it's important to not only hone the senses but also to have a 'bouncing board'. As important as it is to cup and to analyze each session with a microscope to find more tastes, stronger aromas, noticeable defects and perceived sensations, it is also essential to have a person or a group of persons that you trust and that you can challenge with your own thoughts. There is nothing funner than a bunch of people getting tastes and aromas from coffees like a magician pulls rabbits out a hat.<br><br>
          I still dream of that cup and that banana taste. Gracias Neptaly!<br><br>
