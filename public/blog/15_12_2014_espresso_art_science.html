          Do you remember Wile E. Coyote chasing around the Roadrunner with the most complicated machinery ever assembled? Since we were talking about crazy scientists last time I thought I could carry along the same line. If you still haven't seen one of these inviduals in action, find your local specialty coffee shop and observe the barista. Make sure you read well when I said specialty, because that does not mean the cafe in the corner of La Bastille. In that case, you might as well drink straight from the river. It will be difficult to find out, but when you find that place with Kee's latest machine and the scent of fresh beans swirling in the air, that's where you will find your crazy scientist. <br><br> 
          You walk in and encounter intellectuals, hipsters and bon vivants all under the same roof. How is that possible? But then you hear the clicks and the clacks, so you decide to look behind the bar. Someone has just ordered an espresso, but unlike 99% of baristas, this guy, sporting a haircut straight out of Back to the Future, doesn't just serve an espresso...he actually makes it. Big difference. In his head their are ratios flying, viscosity levels being calculated and most importantly, there is a search for perfection with each pour. I had never noticed this until I began immersing myself in a world that can be likened to medieval blacksmithing. I began to see a craft fueling modern day reality with a guild and a standard that continue to grow every day in quality, reach and impact. <br><br>
          The research and the observation, paired with a number of other factors, fed a fascination that quickly turned into an obsession. I come from a country that produces some of the rarest and most exclusive coffee beans in the planet, so I would be a bit of a walking contradiction if I couldn't make a good cup of coffee. So little by little I directed my readings towards coffee shops and what happens behind the bar. Came up with two very dominant subjects: espresso and microfoam. I concluded that if I could master those two areas and reach a solid level of understanding and execution, then the rest was just a matter of personal taste and practice, practice, practice. But I quickly ran into a problem. I didn't own an espresso machine, or a hot steam jet, or a precision grinder, or a scientific balance. I needed a lab. Most importantly, I needed that mad scientist. <br><br>
          I began talking to friends and frequenting the coffee shops in Paris and in London where I always ended my conversations with the same question: 'Who is the best barista in town?'. This led me to meet Chris Nielsen, the mind behind Fondation Cafe, in the heart of Paris. I know he is a modest guy who wouldn't appreciate this, but awesome men must be spoken of. Chris is what we call a modern day artisan. He honed his craft in some of the most detail-oriented cities in the world acquiring a level of understanding that could only by described as coffee polyglotism. So after roaming his coffee lab for a few days I took a shot and asked him if I could learn from him. I handed him a list of objectives. He took out a pen, scratched a few and then smiled. He took me as his apprentice. <br><br>
          He taught me many things that made coffee borderline with thermal engineering. And then he poured a perfect espresso. Chris poured that espresso. Over and over and over. That is one of the main things he taught me. Dialing in. Setting up your gear as if you were going to operate a nuclear facility. The cleaner, the more functional, the simpler your work area, the better your work will be. And then just getting it right every time. He first made me taste a couple of espressos and then we searched for similar tastes. I couldn't taste much, which became frustrating when he described it as a full bodied, citric, clean cup Ethiopian. <br><br>
          This made way to my first encounter with really tasting coffee. The coffee taste matrix which divides into four categories: sweet, sour, metalic and bitter. Three of those are easy to understand, the metalic taste can be found when you eat soja beans. Or perhaps not. But the click moment came when I was told that each taste was perceived by a different part of the mouth: the back, the sides, the tong, the whole mouth. The next espressos were still tasting like good coffee but some had a bitter, back of the mouth, taste. Baristas try to objectively serve clients a sweet or long dans la bouche espresso. From that moment on I tasted every espresso as an amateur 1-time-per-month wine taster tastes every glass put before him. But I did begin to notice tastes every time I visited a different coffee shop with different extraction skills. <br><br>
          After I could taste a bit, notice differences and knew what needed to be changed in order to get a clean cup, then we saw the elements that made up a shot of espresso: the roasted beans, the grinder, the scales, the basket size, the machine (the water). We went through each of these elements to find imperfections, weak points. When he switched the grinder was when it became chaos. You see their are three types of grinders, but this particular conical burr is a fixed attraction at every shop in Paris. Efficient, good looking, easy to use. But the two variables, grind size and dosage, can usually become a headache when you realize that its like x and y on a Cartesian plane and you need to tweak over and over to get them to intersect. That's how you get the perfect grind. If you want to go by common theory, the dosage should be around the same size as the basket (take or add a gram). So 18g baskets should use 17-19g grinds. The machine, whether it's a Marzocco or a Mirage or a Rocket, will also play with two variables, time and weight of espresso. In come the scientific scales which are used for two variables again, weight of grind (after subtracting the weight of port-a-filter) and weight of espresso (after subtracting weight of cup). So you see how it becomes like a chemistry lab where every element can be modified to yield a completely different product. And then of course there is the most important element, the roasted bean. A good barista will only choose the best roasted coffee beans that they can get their hands on. Sometimes they come from a friend who is a roaster or sometimes they come from a sourcer on the other side of the world. The roasted bean makes the coffee. But the barista makes it a delicious coffee. <br><br>
          It's funny that the SCAA has strict guidelines as to what an espresso is. They say an espresso is a 45ml (1.5 ounces) beverage that is prepared from 7-9 grams of coffee through which clean water of 192ยก - 198ยก F (88ยก - 92ยก C) has been forced at 9-10 atmospheres of pressure, where the grind of the coffee has made the brewing "flow"* time approximately 22-28 seconds. While brewing, the flow of Espresso will appear to have the viscosity of warm honey and the resulting beverage will exhibit a thick dark gold cream foam ("crema") topping. Espresso is usually prepared specifically for, and immediately served to its intended consumer. I never saw this until after I had finished training with Chris. It's ironic that we winged it trying to use the senses and the advantages of some machines to create perfect espressos while averaging more or less the same time, temperature and appeal that the SCAA calls the ultimate standard. Only through the senses can you make sure that espresso pours like warm honey. <br><br>
          Chris speaks of it as a car mechanic would talk about a GTO (he loves that stuff). He showed me how to be really geeky about coffee when you start looking at numbers such as the total dissolved particles (TDS) in your espresso or the precise extraction ratios. You can start cracking every bean you can get your hands on to study the distributed roasting profile of each batch. You can find imperfections and surprises. And then you can always go make an espresso in the farm of the guy that planted the coffee. Although that would be extreme. Espresso is a culture, an art and a science. Mastering its texture, its dosage, and then doing it 20 times without getting it wrong once. That's the magic behind it. Thank you Chris for showing me that world. <br><br>
