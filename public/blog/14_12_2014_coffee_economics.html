          Have you ever heard of a type of entrepreneur who wishes to master his craft yet his sole desire above that is to remain incognito throughout the process? I met him the other day. Let’s call him Pierre. He started with big money dreams in consulting giants only to go through a radical direction change. It’s not a bad thing to sit around and dissect balance sheets until 2am, but it’s not made for everyone. Therefore Pierre decided that he wanted to create a small business for himself. He researched the latest trends, new technologies and macroeconomic trends. All this made him choose: coffee. Why? For many reasons that you can find in sources as trustworthy as Wikipedia and as witchhunted as the latest edition of VICE. Pierre concluded that he would start a coffee business.<br><br>
          Decisions are some of the worst obstacles our instincts have before them when momentum is rolling. Pierre had tried to go into importing and it had not gone well. No serious damage but the morale got hit. He began roasting from a small shop in the outskirts of a big city. Diedrich IR12. Kees van der Westen Speedster. Mahlkoenig EK 43. The whole lab. Business went well, things evolved, vision got distorted but then it got boring just to be doing that one same thing. He needed to get out of the four wall scenario. He wanted to be doing more. He began traveling to the farms, interning himself in the culture and learning more on his own than through his daily 9-5. After a while he noticed that the true essence behind his passion for coffee did not revolve around a business ecosystem created to exploit this trendy commodity but to craft something incredible out of it…period. Nothing more. Once again he realigned his mind and opened a side business. He sold the roasterie and put coffee on the side.<br><br>
          Normality settle and he began to ponder. He missed coffee. Pierre wanted to give it another go with no idea yet how, but he made himself a promise. Big names, big titles and big company logos used to be his day to day bread and butter back in his balance sheet years but now he wanted to go ghost. On his weekends and on his free time he began putting together a plan to sell to one shop only. He would spend more time finding the right shop than setting up the business’ infrastructure. When he did he went through all the supply chain he would put into place to feed a micro roasting business out of his garage. The business would be 100% self sustainable with two main production outputs: one sole coffee shop and Pierre himself. After all, coffee was his passion. He went to the root. He developed a network of rare coffee traders in Europe who would give him access to the lots they were bringing in at specific times of the year. These coffees would be not only his masterpieces but his experiments. What a joy it was for him to reach that balance point where the profiles and proficiencies in his being blended to fulfill a passion in the purest of ways.<br><br>
          Pierre now has a video production startup, roasts coffee 20 hours a week, studies coffee 7-12 hours a week and sells to a renowned coffee shop in the West Coast. No one knows about his roasting except for a few friends and 4 of the world’s top baristas.
