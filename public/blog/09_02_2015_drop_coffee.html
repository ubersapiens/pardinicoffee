          When I arrived in Stockholm I was impressed by the resemblance it had to Swiss cities bordering large lakes. Except with a touch of vodka and dash of hip punk. Architecture was conservative compared to Western Europe. Fashion and streets all in that same trend as Berlin, Portland and Vancouver. To be honest if it wasn’t so fking cold in the winter, I would consider it an ideal place to live. But it wasn’t until I went into Drop Coffee that the entire scene made sense.<br><br>
          Three Kalitas aligned right in front of the head barista, dripping one of the finest coffees to come out of Central America in a year where leaf rust created catastrophes but those lucky enough to escape were blessed with magic. Tattoos, gourmet treats and a space that screams smooth design without yelling it too loud. Many might pass by the corner of their Mariatorget headquarters and not know, but sometimes in the same 10 square meters you could have the Swedish Barista Champion, the Swedish Latte Art Champion and the Swedish Roasting Champion. How? Because they all work at this lightbulb factory.<br><br>

          Joanna and Erik hold a very special place in my mountain of praise because they welcomed a curious amateur into their coffee laboratories as if I had worked their all my life. They amazed me with coffee economics, cupping tricks, roasting standards, startup numbers, origin stories and best of all, passion generated by love of what you do. Both of them dedicate every breath of their day to making Drop Coffee even better. A plane to Burundi? A new roaster probe? A water quality analysis? It doesn’t matter. The priority is the perfect cup and the impact to the ecosystem behind it. Everything else sits in second row. Why? Because at the end of the day, the craft is an extension of the craftsman’s life.<br><br>
          I strongly believe in mentorship. The Renaissance men and the Medieval guilds got it right. Knowledge and skill must be transmitted from those who wield with ease to those who dream of it and are ready to do anything to reach those unreachable heights. They say that the most gifted individuals are not those that shift the world, but those who shift the world and then stop to teach others how they did it. Drop Coffee is not just a coffee shop or a roastery. It’s a school. A school of dreams.<br><br>
          So like if it was the first day of elementary, it was 8am and I was standing outside of Drop Coffee. It took a solid 8 minutes to decide to go in, partly because it was April and still 0 degrees, partly because I was very nervous. Just for a quick perceptive zap let me tell you that I grew up playing in the farms where the producers drink their cup with 2 spoons of sugar. I never dreamed of the third wave changing everything and changing me as well. But once it did, if there was one thing that I coveted, it was roasting. I searched all over, from Hong Kong to El Salvador and from the United States to Australia, and my final choice was Joanna Alm, roaster and co-owner of Drop Coffee in Stockholm. So riding on that impulsive hyperactivity I packed my bags one day, grabbed a flight and headed over to the Tesla-looking coffee lab in the middle of the Sodermalm neighborhood. And so the mentorship door opened.<br><br>
          Before I met Joanna and Erik, I met Alexander Ruas, known in the underground rings as the Messi of Extraction. It was Alex who talked to me about extraction yields, ideal grind distribution and the perfect temperature of water for each filter method. Alex made it possible for me to become an apprentice at Drop. Erik taught me about the necessary numbers for a coffee startup to thrive, the trips he and Stephane Cataldi made together and his macro views from farm to coffee bar. The third special member of the Alchemists team, was Joanna. So proud and honored to have met such a cool and extremely talented person. Maillard reactions, SCAA protocol cupping, wine vs coffee tasting, air flow control and Fazenda Ambiental Fortaleza. All discussed, analyzed, learned. In the end, after it was all over, I felt a bit like Luke Skywalker after leaving Yoda's little planet.<br><br>
          A few weeks later I sat in a coffee shop in Paris pondering every single word that had been uttered while I was in that Sodermalm coffee utopia-sphere. It made me remember a promise I made to someone very special. One roast profile. Not espresso, filter, blend. Just one. A perfect one. All the way through. And a roast that brings out the universe of flavors that resides in each bean.<br><br>
          Promise still solid…<br><br>
          Tak Erik! Tak Joanna! Tak Alex!<br><br>
