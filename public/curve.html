          We have been roasting this coffee with a high amount of heat at the beginning in order to later on decrease. Charge temperature has been standard for all 207-210 C. We take out the between 12:30 to 12:55 to allow the caramelization to fully instill in this bean a taste of milk/dark chocolate. I would say a 30/70 ratio. It's delicious.<br><br>
          Wilford Lamastus has been innovating the practices at Elida Estate since the moment his father took him to the farm for the first time. He has applied tasting protocols, picking techniques, revolutionary honey-processing and business strategy to an estate producing some of the most prized coffees in Panama at the moment. It was fascinating to hear him speak about the deep taste profiles that some of these coffees could exhibit.
